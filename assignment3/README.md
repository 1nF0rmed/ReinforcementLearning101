# Assignment 3

In this assignment, you will be tasked with refactoring the implementation of a simple Actor-Critic Model to work with Atari and other such environments.

## Details

The jupyter notebook ("Actor_Critic_Code_Example.ipynb") contains explanation and code to run Actor-Critic implementation on the CartPole environment. Another notebook is also given as an example implementation of taking an image of the environment as input for the model ("Actor_Critic_Image_Example.ipynb")

Refer: [Research Paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1999/file/6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa-Paper.pdf)

### Tasks

1) Learn and understand the of Actor-Critic model
2) Refactor given implementation to work with Atari environments (use any you choose)
3) Write an implementation that works with the [Robotics environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#robotics) (optional)
