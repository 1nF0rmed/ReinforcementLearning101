# Assignment 2

In this assignment, you will be tasked with implementing the Deep Q Neural Network to interact with the environment.

## Details

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique for determining the worth of a given action in a given state. It doesn't require an environment model, and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without the need for adaptations.

Deep Q-learning uses neural networks to implement this learning approach.

### Tasks

1) Implement Deep Q-learning using PyTorch or Tensorflow
2) Think of ways to improve the approach (optional)
